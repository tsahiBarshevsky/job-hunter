# _Job Hunter - an Online Job Tracker_

When I started the job search process, I used an Excel file to organize all the jobs I've been applied for and later, I found a site that allows doing the same thing more conveniently. But I felt it was very basic and lacking features that could further facilitate the process, so I'm happy to introduce you to Job Hunter - an [upgraded version](https://github.com/tsahiBarshevsky/jobi) of a job tracking site.

Job Hunter allows you to keep track of job applications in a convenient and organized way, update job status easily, view a job timeline from the moment you apply, through a conversation with a recruiter until you get the job. In addition, there are some metrics like weekly and monthly applications and you can also create phone book of contatcs and activities. All you have to do is log in with your Google account and start tracking.
